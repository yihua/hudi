# Hudi-built Apache DataFusion Comet

This directory builds Comet from a pinned upstream commit with a small set of
Hudi-maintained source changes, producing the artifact
`hudi-native-spark-bundle` consumes when the native Hudi scan is enabled. The
changes add a native Hudi table scan to Comet: the Spark side hands each task
its file slices, and the native side reads them (Parquet decode plus
merge-on-read log merging) through [hudi-rs](https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs),
statically linked into `libcomet`.

## Layout

- `COMET_PIN` - the upstream Comet repository and commit, and the version the
  modified build installs as (upstream version plus a `-hudi-<n>` suffix, so the
  unmodified Central artifact can never satisfy the dependency by accident).
  The hudi-rs revision is pinned in `overlay/native/Cargo.toml` and locked in
  `overlay/native/Cargo.lock`.
- `overlay/` - full copies of every Comet file the integration changes or adds,
  mirroring Comet's tree. Applied by copying over a clean checkout of the
  pinned commit.
- `OVERLAY_MANIFEST` - for each overlaid file, the upstream blob SHA it was
  written against (or `new` for added files). `build_comet.sh` verifies the
  manifest before overlaying, so bumping `COMET_COMMIT` fails loudly on any
  file where upstream moved instead of silently discarding the upstream change.
- `build_comet.sh` - clone at the pin, verify, overlay, build (cargo release
  plus Maven), and install to the local Maven repository.

## Building

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=<jdk-17>
./build_comet.sh
```

Requires git, JDK 17, and a Rust toolchain (rustup picks the version from
Comet's `rust-toolchain.toml`). The checkout and build happen under
`target/comet-build` by default (`COMET_BUILD_DIR` overrides; point it at a
cached location in CI). `COMET_SPARK_PROFILE` selects the Comet Spark profile
(default `spark-3.5`); the default `release` make target compiles for the build
machine's CPU, so portable artifacts should use Comet's per-platform release
targets via `COMET_MAKE_TARGET`.

The bundle then builds against the result with:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dspark3.5 \
  -Dcomet.hudi.build -Ddatafusion.comet.version=1.0.0-hudi-1 \
  -pl packaging/hudi-native-spark-bundle -am
```

`-Dcomet.hudi.build` adds the `hudi-spark-comet` glue module (the Comet scan
provider that extracts Hudi file slices at plan time) to the reactor and to the
bundle. At runtime the native scan is off until
`spark.comet.scan.hudi.enabled=true` is set; without it the bundle behaves
exactly like one built against the published Comet.

## Changing the integration

Edit a checkout of Comet at the pinned commit (or let `build_comet.sh` create
one), then copy the changed files back into `overlay/` and refresh
`OVERLAY_MANIFEST`:

```bash
git -C <checkout> rev-parse <commit>:<path>   # blob SHA for a modified file
```

Bumping `COMET_COMMIT` or the hudi-rs revision requires re-running the native
bundle validation with `NATIVE_HUDI_SCAN=1` (see
`packaging/bundle-validation/native_spark/`).
